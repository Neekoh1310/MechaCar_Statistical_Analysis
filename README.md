# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
In this project, I was tasked to analyze a new prototype vehicle, the MechaCar, that is being produced by AutosRUs. The MechaCar is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing the team's progress. Here are the following tasks that I was assigned to perform

  - Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
  - Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  - Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  - Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll   write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Resources
- RStudio, Data (MechaCar_mpg.csv, Suspension_Coil.csv)

## Results 
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- MechaCar Data and Linear Regression Data
